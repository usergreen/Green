#. TRANSLATOR: Change this to the default location name,

#. * the common localised name that corresponds to
#. * the location code (DEFAULT_CODE) you will put on the next message
#. * For example, for the Greek locale, we set this to "Athens", the
#. * capital city and we write it in Greek. It's important to translate
#. * this name.
#. *
#. * If you do not require a DEFAULT_LOCATION, set this to
#. * "DEFAULT_LOCATION".

#. * If you do not require a DEFAULT_CODE, set this to "DEFAULT_CODE".
